abstract = {Since battery life directly impacts the extent and duration of
mobility, one of the key considerations in the design of a mobile
embedded system should be to maximize the energy delivered by the
battery, and hence the battery lifetime. To facilitate exploration of
alternative implementations for a mobile embedded system, in this paper
we address the issue of developing a fast and accurate battery model,
and providing a framework for battery life estimation of
Hardware/Software (HW/SW) embedded systems. We introduce a stochastic
model of a battery, which can simultaneously model two key phenomena
affecting the battery life and the amount of energy that can be
delivered by the battery: the rate capacity effect and the recovery
effect. We model the battery behavior mathematically in terms of
parameters that can be related to physical characteristics of the
electro-chemical cell. We show how this model can be used for battery
life estimation of a HW/SW embedded system, by calculating battery
discharge demand waveforms using a power co-estimation technique. Based
on the discharge demand, the battery model estimates the battery
lifetime as well as the delivered energy. Application of the battery
life estimation methodology to three system implementations of an
example TCP/IP network interface subsystem demonstrates that different
system architectures can have significantly different delivered energy
and battery lifetimes},
